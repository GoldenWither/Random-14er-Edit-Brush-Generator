# Random-14er-Edit-Brush-Generator
A program that generates random brushes for 14erEdit, under many user-chosen parameters.

### The Basics
##### Running the program
To run, *make sure python is installed*. Double click "main.py" and use the gui to generate some fabulous brushes.

#### Exporting brushes
Clicking "Output to File" places all the brushes currently in the output box into a new "Brush Output.txt" file, in the same directory main.py was ran in.
If "Brush Output.txt" already exists, the new brushes will be appended to the end of the file.

#### Adding palattes
To add a new set of blocks to choose from, add a new text file in the "Block Pallates" directory. The file should have exactly one string per line, with no extra space at the beginning or end.
Restart the gui (if it is open) and the new file will appear in the dropdown menu.
