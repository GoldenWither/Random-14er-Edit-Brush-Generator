# Random-14er-Edit-Brush-Generator
A program that generates random brushes for 14erEdit, under many user-chosen parameters.

To run, make sure python is installed. Double click "main.py" and use the gui to generate some fabulous brushes.

Clicking "Output to File" places all the brushes currently in the output box into a new "Brush Output.txt" file, in the same directory main.py was ran in.
If "Brush Output.txt" already exists, the new brushes will be appended to the end of the file.
